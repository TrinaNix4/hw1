// Loops
// 1. Write a for loop that logs only logs even numbers from 0 - 10; ie 0,2,4,..10
// 2. Write a for that logs numbers from 10 - 0; ie 10,9,8...0
// 3. write a for loop that loops through this array and logs 'odd/even' based on wether the number is odd even

let i = 1
for(i=0; i<=10; i++){
  if (i % 2 == 0){
    console.log('The number' + '' + i 'is even.')
  }
